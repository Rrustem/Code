# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture
This week (week 0) we were given a task to make an architecture diagram for a social application called Crudder. 
For the diagram we were instructed to use Lucid App - first time I heard about it - to make a Lucid Chart. 
Anyway, I made a really good Chart following the Instructor Andrew Brown. 

If you click on [__this link__](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/c14b969b-f1cc-4a70-8b34-ee7db6685720/edit?invitationId=inv_e35db023-59f7-4a48-96a4-dfb51681fc84&page=0_0#
"Cruddur Arch Diagram") it will send you to my chart

Since I started my homework a bit late, I couldn't do some extra stuff in here.

I hope these coming weeks I'll be more engaged and do more about the homework.

Otherwise, I attended *Azure* trainings from Andrew and passed 4 base level exams *(Az-900, DP-900. AI-900, SC-900)*

I hope to take some certs on AWS too, and this Bootcamp is super important for me.
